# Mapping_Earthquakes
The Mapping_Earthquakes project is about reflecting earthquake activites with data. Building insightful data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. In this project we utilized the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website. We then traversed and retrieved the earthquake data using JavaScript, D3.js, Leaflet libraries and then plotted the map data on a Mapbox map through an API request. 

We displayed the magnitude and location of the earthquake on a popup marker on our final map. The diameter of each map marker will correspond to the magnitude, size, and color of the earthquake. 

Earthquakes with larger magnitudes will appear larger/darker in color, with a legend giving context for the map data. Finally, to illustrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, we would add faultlines on the map. 

- Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

- Tasks:
To complete this project, we would use URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data, and GeoJSON major earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We would also use a URL to map tectomic plates, and finally we would add the data to a map.

- Approach:
We will use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Next, we will use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

### Tools Used:
1. Mapbox API
2. D3.js library
3. Leaflet: an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
4. HTML and CSS to render and style the webpage
5. GeoJSON
